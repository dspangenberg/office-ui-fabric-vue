\"<p>Progress Indicators are used to show the completion status of an operation lasting more than 2 seconds. If the state of progress cannot be determined, use a Spinner instead. Progress Indicators can appear in a new panel, a flyout, under the UI initiating the operation, or even replacing the initiating UI, as long as the UI can return if the operation is canceled or is stopped.</p>\\n<p>Progress Indicators feature a bar showing total units to completion, and total units finished. The description of the operation appears above the bar, and the status in text appears below. The description should tell someone exactly what the operation is doing. Examples of formatting include:</p>\\n<p><strong>[Object]</strong> is being <strong>[operation name]</strong>, or<br><strong>[Object]</strong> is being <strong>[operation name]</strong> to <strong>[destination name]</strong> or<br><strong>[Object]</strong> is being <strong>[operation name]</strong> from <strong>[source name]</strong> to <strong>[destination name]</strong>  </p>\\n<p>Status text is generally in units elapsed and total units. If the operation can be canceled, an “X” glyph is used and should be placed in the upper right, aligned with the baseline of the operation name. When an error occurs, replace the status text with the error description using ms-fontColor-redDark.</p>\\n<p>Real-world examples include copying files to a storage location, saving edits to a file, and more. Use units that are informative and relevant to give the best idea to users of how long the operation will take to complete. Avoid time units as they arerarely accurate enough to be trustworthy. Also combine steps of a complex operation into one total bar to avoid “rewinding” the bar. Instead change the operation description to reflect the change if necessary. Bars moving backwards reduce confidence in the service.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/progress_indicator/overview.md\n// module id = 46Z4\n// module chunks = 0","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'tags': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M14.594 4l-.313.28-11 11-.685.72.687.72 9 9 .72.686.72-.687 11-11 .28-.315V4H14.594zm.844 2H23v7.563l-10 10L5.437 16l10-10zM26 7v2h1v8.156l-9.5 9.438-1.25-1.25-1.406 1.406 1.937 1.97.72.686.69-.687L28.72 18.31 29 18V7h-3zm-6 1a1 1 0 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0-2z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/tags.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'numbered-list': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M5.97 3l-.314.344S4.9 4 4.406 4v2c.68 0 1.15-.276 1.594-.53V10h2V3H5.97zM11 6v2h17V6H11zm-4.5 6A2.497 2.497 0 0 0 4 14.5v.5h2v-.5c0-.217.283-.5.5-.5.217 0 .5.283.5.5l-.03.03-.064.064-2.593 2.5-.313.28V19h5v-2H7.28l.876-.875.125-.094-.03-.03c.502-.41.75-1.02.75-1.5A2.499 2.499 0 0 0 6.5 12zm4.5 3v2h17v-2H11zm-7 6v2h1.375l-.25.406-.125.22V25h1.5c.217 0 .5.283.5.5 0 .217-.283.5-.5.5H4v2h2.5C7.883 28 9 26.883 9 25.5c0-1.005-.678-1.696-1.53-2.094l.405-.687.125-.25V21H4zm7 3v2h17v-2H11z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/numbered-list.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'arrows-long-right': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M21.188 9.28l-1.407 1.44L24.063 15H4v2h20.063l-4.282 4.28 1.407 1.44 6-6 .72-.72-.72-.72-6-6z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/arrows-long-right.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'info': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M16 3C8.832 3 3 8.832 3 16s5.832 13 13 13 13-5.832 13-13S23.168 3 16 3zm0 2c6.087 0 11 4.913 11 11s-4.913 11-11 11S5 22.087 5 16 9.913 5 16 5zm-1 5v2h2v-2h-2zm0 4v8h2v-8h-2z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/info.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'resize-four-directions': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M4 4v9h2V7.437L14.563 16 6 24.563V19H4v9h9v-2H7.437L16 17.437 24.563 26H19v2h9v-9h-2v5.563L17.437 16 26 7.437V13h2V4h-9v2h5.563L16 14.563 7.437 6H13V4H4z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/resize-four-directions.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'crop': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M8 4v4H4v2h4v14h14v4h2v-4h4v-2H11.437L22 11.437V21h2V9.437l3.72-3.718-1.44-1.44L22.563 8H11v2h9.563L10 20.563V4H8z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/crop.js","module.exports = \"<p>Callouts are a powerful way to simplify a user interface. They host tips and other information users need when they need it, with minimal effort on their part. Callouts can help you use screen space more effectively and reduce screen clutter. However, poorly designed Callouts can be annoying, distracting, unhelpful, overwhelming, or in the way.</p>\\n<p>Use a Callout for displaying additional contextual information about an item on the screen. Unlike Tooltips, Callouts also have a tail that identifies their source. A common use for Callout is the introduction of a new feature or capability of an app or site. Alternate usages include pairing the Callout with a button or clickable element for on-demand presentation of additional or supporting content.</p>\\n<p>Real-world examples of this implementation can be seen in administrative interfaces where a particularly difficult-to-understand concept is paired with the ms-Icon--info &quot;i&quot; icon. In this example, Callout - with its tip text - is opened when the user clicks on or hovers over the icon.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/callout/overview.md\n// module id = 4xIf\n// module chunks = 0","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'timeline': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M4 4v24h2v-5h2.188c.418 1.156 1.52 2 2.812 2 1.292 0 2.394-.844 2.813-2H28v-2H13.812c-.418-1.156-1.52-2-2.812-2-1.292 0-2.394.844-2.813 2H6v-4h14.188c.418 1.156 1.52 2 2.812 2 1.292 0 2.394-.844 2.813-2H28v-2h-2.188c-.418-1.156-1.52-2-2.812-2-1.292 0-2.394.844-2.813 2H6v-4h7.188c.418 1.156 1.52 2 2.812 2 1.292 0 2.394-.844 2.813-2H28V9h-9.188c-.418-1.156-1.52-2-2.812-2-1.292 0-2.394.844-2.813 2H6V4H4zm12 5c.564 0 1 .436 1 1 0 .564-.436 1-1 1-.564 0-1-.436-1-1 0-.564.436-1 1-1zm7 6c.564 0 1 .436 1 1 0 .564-.436 1-1 1-.564 0-1-.436-1-1 0-.564.436-1 1-1zm-12 6c.564 0 1 .436 1 1 0 .564-.436 1-1 1-.564 0-1-.436-1-1 0-.564.436-1 1-1z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/timeline.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'rotate-left': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M15 3v2h1V3h-1zm-2.156.438L12 3.655l-.03.03-.033.002-.843.312h-.03l-.033.03-.092.032.843 1.813h.033l.062-.03.688-.25.062-.032.78-.22-.56-1.905zM20 4v8h2V6.78c3.03 1.98 5 5.28 5 9.22 0 6.055-4.945 11-11 11S5 22.055 5 16v-1H3v1c0 7.145 5.855 13 13 13s13-5.855 13-13c0-4.06-1.795-7.615-4.656-10H28V4h-8zM9.156 5l-.53.344-.032.03h-.03l-.69.532-.03.032h-.032l-.28.25 1.312 1.5.22-.188.06-.03.563-.44L9.75 7l.47-.313L9.155 5zM6.094 7.594l-.22.28-.03.032-.032.032-.53.687v.03l-.032.033-.344.53 1.688 1.095.28-.47.064-.062.437-.592.03-.032.22-.25-1.53-1.312zM3.97 11l-.033.125-.03.03v.033L3.593 12v.03l-.03.064-.22.844 1.906.53.22-.78.03-.063.25-.688.03-.062v-.03L3.97 11z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/rotate-left.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'generic-sorting-2': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M4 5v2h2V5H4zm17 0v18.688l-2.594-2.594L17 22.5l4.28 4.313.72.687.72-.688L27 22.5l-1.406-1.406L23 23.687V5h-2zM4 9v2h4V9H4zm0 4v2h6v-2H4zm0 4v2h8v-2H4zm0 4v2h10v-2H4zm0 4v2h12v-2H4z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/generic-sorting-2.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'key': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M20 3c-4.945 0-9 4.055-9 9 0 .52.085.978.156 1.438L3.28 21.28l-.28.314V29h7v-3h3v-3h3v-2.97c1.18.58 2.555.97 4 .97 4.945 0 9-4.055 9-9s-4.055-9-9-9zm0 2c3.855 0 7 3.145 7 7s-3.145 7-7 7a7.37 7.37 0 0 1-3.406-.875l-.25-.125H14v3h-3v3H8v3H5v-4.563l7.906-7.937.375-.344-.092-.53c-.1-.6-.188-1.137-.188-1.626 0-3.855 3.145-7 7-7zm2 3a2 2 0 1 0-.001 3.999A2 2 0 0 0 22 8z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/key.js","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'brush': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M24.813 4.03c-.837 0-1.68.337-2.313.97L9.812 17.5l-.624.594c-.75.14-1.467.51-2.032 1.125-.833.908-.995 2.02-1.312 3.218-.318 1.196-.72 2.526-1.688 4l-1 1.562H5c3.915 0 6.495-1.87 7.813-3.188l.03-.03c.603-.617.94-1.395 1.063-2.188l.5-.47 12.688-12.5v-.03a3.253 3.253 0 0 0 0-4.594c-.634-.633-1.445-.97-2.282-.97zm0 1.97c.313 0 .608.14.875.406.533.534.533 1.248 0 1.782l-9.032 8.937-1.812-1.813 9.062-8.906c.267-.266.593-.406.907-.406zM13.405 16.72l1.813 1.81-1.5 1.47-1.814-1.813 1.5-1.468zM9.97 20.03a2.31 2.31 0 0 1 1.467.595c.778.712.796 1.954-.03 2.78-.87.87-2.408 1.986-4.657 2.407.48-1.05.815-2.03 1.03-2.843.334-1.255.578-2.116.845-2.407.347-.38.838-.546 1.344-.532z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/brush.js","module.exports = \"<pre><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>ou-callout</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">:showClose</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>true<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>All of your favorite people<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>Message body is optional.

selection, mouse hover or keyboard focus. They are one of the most effective and highly used command surfaces, and can be used in a variety of places.</p>\\n<p>There are variants that originate from a command bar, or from cursor or focus. Those that come from CommandBars use a beak that is horizontally centered on the button. Ones that come from right click and menu button do not have a beak, but appear to the right and below the cursor. ContextualMenus can have submenus from commands, show selection checks, and icons.</p>\\n<p>Organize commands in groups divided by rules. This helps users remember command locations, or find less used commands based on proximity to others. One should also group sets of mutually exclusive or multiple selectable options. Use icons sparingly, for high value commands, and don’t mix icons with selection checks, as it makes parsing commands difficult. Avoid submenus of submenus as they can be difficult to invoke or remember.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/contextual_menu/overview.md\n// module id = Txdd\n//

\"<p>SearchBoxes provide an input field for searching through content, allowing users to locate specific items within the website or app.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"zero-input-state\\\">Zero input state</h2>\\n<p>When the user has clicked into the SearchBox, but has not entered any text, there is an opportunity to display &quot;hint text&quot; within the input field, explaining what a user can do next. This could prompt a user to search for specific type content, or explain the scope of the search. Examples include &quot;type to search&quot;, &quot;try searching for <x>&quot;, &quot;search for a place&quot; or &quot;type to search in <x location>&quot;.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"autocomplete-suggestions\\\">Autocomplete suggestions</h2>\\n<p>As the user enters a query string, they are provided with a dropdown of autocomplete suggestions or disambiguation options. This will help them expedite the input process and formulate an effective query. Recent search history, trending searches, contextual search suggestions, hints and tips are all good candidates for autocomplete content. In general, autocomplete suggestions have the user&#39;s input highlighted in some way (generally bolded) to indicate why it&#39;s being displayed. As the user enters more keystrokes, the suggestions update continuously/in real time. To see autocomplete suggestions, the user does not need to hit enter (execute a full search), as it is a lightweight way to get quick suggestions or results. If there are mixed result types within the autocomplete suggestions, provide visual indicators or grouping to help organize the information, making it easier to parse.</p>\\n<p>As a general guideline, results should be displayed in context with the query that was typed, with immediate access to edit the query or enter a new one. One method to enable efficient access to both edit the previous query and enter a new query is to highlight the previous query when the field is reactivated. This way, any keystroke will replace the previous string, but the string is maintained so that the user can position a cursor to edit or append the previous string.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"search-scopes\\\">Search scopes</h2>\\n<p>Although search entry points tend to be similarly visualized, they can provide access to results that range from broad to narrow. By effectively communicating the scope of a search, you can help to ensure that the user expectation will be met by the capabilities of the search you are performing, which will reduce the possibility of frustration. The search entry point should be juxtaposed with the content being searched.</p>\\n<p>Some common search scopes include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Global:</strong> Search across multiple sources of cloud and local content. Varied results include URLs, documents, media, actions, apps, and more.</li>\\n<li><strong>Web:</strong> Search a web index. Results include pages, entities, and answers.</li>\\n<li><strong>My stuff:</strong> Search across device(s), cloud, social graphs, and more. Results are varied, but are constrained by the connection to user account(s).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"searchbox-with-no-parent-container\\\">SearchBox with no parent container</h2>\\n<p>Use a SearchBox without a parent container when it is not restricted to a certain width to accommodate other content. This search box will span the entire width of the space it&#39;s in.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/search_box/overview.md\n// module id = c0gv\n// module

They are one of the most visible and recognizable ways to surface commands, and can be an intuitive method for interacting with content on the page. However, if overloaded or poorly organized, they can be difficult to use and hide valuable commands from your user. CommandBars can also display a search box for finding content; hold simple commands as well as menus; and display the status of ongoing actions.</p>\\n<p>Commands should be sorted in order of importance, from left to right or right to left depending on the culture. Secondarily, organize commands in logical groupings for easier recall. CommandBars work best when they display no more than 5-7 commands. This helps users quickly find your most valuable features. If you need to show more commands, consider using the overflow menu. If you need to render status, or viewing controls, these go on the right side of the CommandBar (or left side if in a left to right experience). Do not display more than 2-3 items on the right side as it will make the overall CommandBar difficult to parse.</p>\\n<p>All command items should have an icon and a label. Commands can render as labels only as well. In smaller widths, commands can just use icon only, but only for the most recognizable and frequently used commands. All other commands should go into an overflow where text labels can be shown.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/command_bar/overview.md\n// module id = xpPX\n// module chunks = 0","/* eslint-disable */\nexport default {\n  'clipboard': {\n    width: 16,\n    height: 16,\n    viewBox: '0 0 32 32',\n    data: '<path pid=\"0\" d=\"M16 3c-1.26 0-2.152.89-2.594 2H6v23h20V5h-7.406C18.152 3.89 17.26 3 16 3zm0 2c.555 0 1 .445 1 1v1h3v2h-8V7h3V6c0-.555.445-1 1-1zM8 7h2v4h12V7h2v19H8V7z\"/>'\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/icons/clipboard.js","module.exports = \"<pre><code>  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>ou-persona</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">initials</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>AD<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">primaryText</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>Aide Woode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">/></span></span>\\n</code></pre>\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/markdown/persona/initialsCode.md\n// module id = xrzy\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<pre><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>ou-callout</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">type</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>actionText<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">title</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>All of your favorite people<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">content</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">'</span>Message body is optional.
